# Refactor

*Previous:* **[04 Deleting Secrets](./04_Deleting_Secrets.md)**

If you look at the code in the solution branch of this project, you will notice that there has been some refactoring. Specifically, some middleware functions have been added to some of the routes. This is probably a better practice than trying to similar code to multiple routes. As with most solutions there are alternatives and better solutions may present themselves over time.

Eventually there will be another part of the workshop here, but until then it's up to you to if you want to refactor. The great part is, since you have these tests in place, you will know right away if you break something during the refactoring process.
